Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use
by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in
ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our
licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the
terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our
licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected.
Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license.
This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an
exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for
licensors: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a
licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material
under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is
not necessary for any reason--for example, because of any applicable
exception or limitation to copyright--then that use is not regulated
by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright
and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use
of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons,
including because others have copyright or other rights in the
material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that
all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our
licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where
reasonable. More considerations for the public:

=======================================================================

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and
agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License ("License"). To
the extent this License may be considered to be a contract, the
Licensor grants You the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor retains and
reserves all other rights available to it.

1. Definitions

   a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
      Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
      and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
      arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner
      requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held
      by the Licensor. For purposes of this License, where the
      Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound
      recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed
      Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.

   b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
      and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
      accordance with the terms and conditions of this License.

   c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar
      rights closely related to copyright including, without
      limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui
      Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are
      labeled or categorized. For purposes of this License, the rights
      specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
      Rights.

   d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in
      the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under
      laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO
      Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar
      international agreements.

   e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
      any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar
      Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

   f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
      or other material to which the Licensor applied this License.

   g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
      terms and conditions of this License, which are limited to all
      Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
      Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

   h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
      under this License.

   i. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed
      towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For
      purposes of this License, the exchange of the Licensed Material
      for other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by
      digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided
      there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection with
      the exchange.

   j. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
      process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
      as reproduction, public display, public performance,
      distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and
      to make material available to the public including in ways that
      members of the public may access the material from a place and
      at a time individually chosen by them.

   k. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
      resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and
      of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
      databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other
      essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

   l. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed
      Rights under this License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

2. Scope

   a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the
          Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

               A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                  in part; and
               B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this License
          does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms
          and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this License is specified in Section 6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
          created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do
          so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any
          right or authority to forbid You from making technical
          modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,
          including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
          Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this
          License, simply making modifications authorized by this
          Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.

   b. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
      Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this License does
      not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and
      conditions.

   c. No term or condition is waived or altered by the mere act of
      exercising the Licensed Rights. Nothing in this License is
      intended to or may be used to defeat the purposes of the
      Exception and Limitations, for example by allowing You to
      aggregate the Licensed Material with other works that are not
      subject to the terms of this License and sell the aggregate.

   d. License conditions. Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is
      expressly made subject to the following conditions.

       1. Attribution.
           A. If You Share the Licensed Material, You must:

               i. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                  with the Licensed Material:
                  - identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
                  - a copyright notice;
                  - a notice that refers to this License;
                  - a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;
                  - a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

               ii. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                  retain an indication of any previous modifications;
                  and

               iii. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under
                    this License, and include the text of, or the URI
                    or hyperlink to, this License.

           B. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
              reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
              context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For
              example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions
              by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that
              includes the required information.

           C. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
              information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
              reasonably practicable.

       2. NonCommercial. You may not exercise any of the rights granted
          to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily
          intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
          private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Licensed
          Material for other material subject to Copyright and Similar
          Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is
          NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary
          compensation in connection with the exchange.

       3. NoDerivatives. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the
          Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of
          the Adapted Material from complying with this License.

   5. Term and Termination.

   a. The term of this License is specified in Section 6(a).
   b. The Licensor may terminate this License at any time if You are
      in breach of the terms of this License.
   c. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated
      under Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or
       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
   right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
   of this License.

   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing
      so will not terminate this License.

   6. Other Terms and Conditions.

   a. Except as expressly stated herein, this License does not grant
      You any rights in the Licensed Material, including but not
      limited to the Licensed Rights.

   b. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

   c. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
      independent of the terms and conditions of this License.

   7. Interpretation.

   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this License does not, and shall
      not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could
      lawfully be made without permission under this License.

   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this License is
      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to
      the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the
      provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this
      License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining
      terms and conditions.

   c. No term or condition of this License will be waived and no
      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by
      the Licensor.

   d. Nothing in this License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
      limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
